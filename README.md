# Digit Recognizer DL Project

This is my first CNN project, used <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data?select=sample_submission.csv"> Kaggle Digit Recognizer </a> dataset to train and test my models. Best model so far has about 98% accuracy in test set which splitted from train set. Also tested on the test set of the competition and checked many by myself. Error rate is about 1 in 15. When it comes to new predictions, which are not from the same distribution, if they are thick enough the model can predict it correctly. However, success rate is low for now.
